## How to report a problem

If you have any problem with the project check the [Q&A Discussions] maybe your
question or problem is already answered. Otherwise please open a new discussion!

## How to report an identified bug

Report identified bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox] with [nox-poetry] and [rich] additional dependencies

Once your environment is set-up, install the package with development
requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session:

```console
$ poetry run python
```

or the Python Whiteprint command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run whiteprint
```

To avoid prefixing all your commands by `poetry run` you can source a poetry
shell (or activate a virtual environment such as
[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html),
[Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html),
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or
[venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).

For example to activate a virtual environment with poetry run:

```console
$ poetry shell
```

Then you can just run an interactive Python session or the command-line interface:

```console
$ python
```

or

```console
$ whiteprint
```

## How to test the project

The test suite is managed by [nox] and [nox-poetry].

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=test
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the [Documentation] accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you
can install [pre-commit] as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
